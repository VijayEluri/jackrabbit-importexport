Use it like this:

java -jar jack.jar import sourcefile.xml

Configuration is done in src/jcr.properties
The default configuration assumes that jackrabbit is located at ../jackrabbit/jackrabbit-standalone/

We expect jackrabbit to be located in folder ../jackrabbit/jackrabbit-standalone/
If this is not the case, adapt your build.xml accordingly
